# Z5
A 2.5D Voxel game engine with 4 degrees of freedom, with support for realistic universe-scale distance without loss of precision.
![game image](https://github.com/theKlanc/Z5/blob/master/resources/cap.png?raw=true)
Is currently able to compile to x86-64 targets on Linux and Windows. Also compiles to Nintendo Switch homebrew and Emscripten.
To try it just clone the repo and compile the makefile for your target (use emmake for em.mk, and compile on Windows using Visual Studio / MSVC)
For a demo just visit [z5.ledgedash.com](z5.ledgedash.com), but emscripten builds are experimental, ymmv.
